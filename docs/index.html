<p><code>scalac-profiling</code> is a tool to profile the compilation of your Scala projects and identify bottlenecks with implicit search and macro expansion.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Scala codebases grow over time, and so do compile times. When compile times become unbearable, they can affect both your developer and team’s productivity.</p>
<p>How to battle slow compile times? The first and most important step is to measure them.</p>
<p>A common cause of slow compile times is a misuse of macros or implicits. <code>scalac-profiling</code> helps you chase down compilations bottlenecks, with a special focus on macro expansions and implicit search.</p>
<p>In this guide, we go on a journey to analyze slow compile times in several real-world Scala codebases. In every case study, I walk you through an array of techniques you can apply to speed up the compilation of your projects.</p>
<p>At the end of this document, you will be able to replicate some of my experiments in your own projects and find solutions to increase the productivity of your team. There are many other ways of scaling up big codebases, but in this document we only look into ways to alleviate the price of expensive features in the Scala language.</p>
<h2 id="case-studies">Case studies</h2>
<h3 id="scalatestscalatest"><a href="https://github.com/scalatest/scalatest">scalatest/scalatest</a></h3>
<p>Scalatest is the most popular testing framework in the Scala community and is widely used in the communities of other JVM-based programming languages like Java.</p>
<p>In this case study, we’re going to compile the test suite of Scalatest. This test suite is <strong>300.000 LOC</strong> and makes a heavy use of Scalatest macros (for example, to get the position of a certain assertion, or to make typesafe comparisons between numeric values) and implicits.</p>
<p>This test suite is an extreme case of what a big test suite could look like in your project, but it’s a good example to test our skills identifying bottlenecks in implicit search and macro expansions.</p>

<h2 id="profiling-implicit-search">Profiling implicit search</h2>
<p>Profiling implicit search is useful to answer the following questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What implicit searches happen in my project?</li>
<li>How do all implicit searches interact with each other?</li>
<li>Are implicit searches the main bottleneck of my compile times?</li>
</ol>
<p>Incidentally, implicit searches also help you to assess how expensive the use of a macro library is, specifically if the macro library relies heavily on implicit search. Libraries that provide generic typeclass derivation are an example.</p>
<h3 id="graphs">Graphs</h3>
<p><code>scalac-profiling</code> generates several graph representations of all the implicit searches happened during compilation. The supported graph representations are <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/command.html">graphviz</a> (aka dot) and <a href="https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph">flamegraph</a>.</p>
<p>The compiler plugin does not generate the graphs for you; instead, it persists the graph data in a format that allows you to generate the graphs yourself without touching or transforming the data.</p>
<p>These graphs are present under the <em>profiledb META-INF directory</em>, located in your classes directory. For example, a flamegraph data file can be located at <code>target/scala-2.12/classes/META-INF/profiledb/graphs/$name.flamegraph</code>.</p>
<h3 id="flamegraphs">Flamegraphs</h3>
<p>If this is the first time you hear about flamegraphs, have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph">official website</a> and the <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2927301">ACM article</a>.</p>
<p>Flamegraphs are graphs that allow you to see the stack of all the implicit search calls that have happened during a concrete compilation. They are intuitive to inspect and to browse, and stand out because:</p>
<ul>
<li>They allow you to selectively choose what things to profile. Click on every stack to zoom in, and reset by clicking “Reset zoom” on the bottom left.</li>
<li>They allow you to search via regexes and those matching stacks are highlighted. Check the search button on the top right.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="flamegraph-generation">Flamegraph generation</h4>
<p>In order to generate flamegraphs, clone <a href="https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph">brendangregg/FlameGraph</a> GitHub repository. The repository provides the tools to generate the svg files that you will later on use.</p>
<p>Next, compile your project with <code>scalac-profiling</code> as a compiler plugin, and statistics enabled (<code>-Ystatistics</code>). <code>scalac-profiling</code> will generate the flamegraph data in the profiledb <code>graphs</code> directory explained in <a href="#graphs">the Graphs section</a>.</p>
<p>Run the following command in the Flamegraph project’s root directory:</p>
<pre><code>./flamegraph.pl --countname=&quot;ms&quot; \
    $PATH_TO_FLAMEGRAPH_FILE &gt; graph.svg</code></pre>
<p>And it will generate something like <a href="circe-integration-flamegraph.svg">this</a>.</p>

<li><a href="scalatest-tests-flamegraph.svg">scalatest tests flamegraph</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dot-graphs">Dot graphs</h3>
<p>The process to generate dot graphs is similar to Flamegraph. Dot graph files are files that declare a graph and tell Graphviz how it should be rendered. They can then be visualized in several ways: a <code>png</code> file, a pdf, a svg, et cetera.</p>
<h4 id="dot-graph-generation">Dot graph generation</h4>
<p>Install <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/command.html">graphviz</a>.</p>
<p>Read <a href="#flamegraph-generation">the previous Flamegraph generation</a> first.</p>
<p>When you compile your project with <code>scalac-profiling</code>, the plugin creates dot files along with the flamegraph data files. You can use these dot files to generate a graph with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>dot -Tsvg -o graph.svg $PATH_TO_DOT_FILE</code></pre>
<p>After that, you can open the resulting svg with your favorite web browser. For example, by running <code>firefox graph.svg</code>.</p>
<p>However, you will quickly realize that exploring larger graphs is difficult with a normal svg. I recommend using <a href="https://github.com/jvican/jquery.graphviz.svg">jquery.graphviz.svg</a> to have a nicer browsing experience: zoom in and out, reset zoom and the killer feature: only highlight the edges for a given node (by clicking on the node).</p>
<h4 id="reading-the-generated-graphs">Reading the generated graphs</h4>
<p>A graph is a set of nodes and edges. A node represent an implicit search for a given type. Every node tells you how many implicit searches have been triggered in total, and how much time they took in total. An edge represents the dependency between an implicit search and another one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="smaller"> Note that every node can be depended upon by others and be the start of the implicit search in the program. That means that often the amount of times a node has been searched for will not be equal to the sum of the nodes that depend on it.</p>
